# Output `output`

<Intro>
The `output` resource allows you to define output variables which can be used 
with the jumppad `output` and `env` commands.

<b>Note:</b> `output` resources are module scoped, `jumppad output` will only show
the value of `output` resources scoped at the top level.
</Intro>

## Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="value" type="string" required="true" value="">
    Value to set to the output, if this value contains an interpolated 
    property from another resource, the output will be created after the 
    referenced resource.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Examples

The following example shows how to use an `output` resource to configure the
environment variable `KUBECONFIG`.

```hcl
output "KUBECONFIG" {
  value = resource.k8s_cluster.k3s.kubeconfig
}
```

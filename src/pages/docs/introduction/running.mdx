# Running

<Intro>
Blueprints are packages of Jumppad configuration which allow you to run cloud native applications on your computer. They can
be run by downloading them to your machine or by running them direct from Git repos.

To take a look at some example blueprints, check out the examples repository.

## Running blueprints from the local filesystem

To run a blueprint from your local machine first clone the example blueprints repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jumppad-labs/examples.git
cd examples
```

You can then run a blueprint and create the resources using the `jumppad up` command with the path of
the blueprint you would like to run. The following example runs a blueprint which runs HashiCorp Vault on
Kubernetes. When you run the following command Jumppad pulls and starts any necessary Docker containers,
then opens the browser windows defined by the blueprint.

```shell
jumppad up ./vault-k8s
Running configuration from:  ./vault-k8s

## Running blueprints from Git repositories

Blueprints can also be run directly from the Git repositories, the following command will download the blueprint
from github and then start any resources defined inside it. Blueprints are downloaded to your `$HOME/.jumppad/blueprints` folder
with the the full repository path.

```shell
jumppad up github.com/jumppad-labs/examples//vault-k8s
```

## Stopping a blueprint

To stop a blueprint use the `jumppad down` command

```shell
jumppad down

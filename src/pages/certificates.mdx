# Certificates

Jumppad uses the certificates hosted at https://jumppad.dev/certificates to provide valid certificates for local resources.
These certificates are all localhost certificates and valid for the following domains: 

- `local.jumppad.dev`
- `*.local.jumppad.dev`
- `local.jmpd.in`
- `*.local.jmpd.in`

This allows you to access services in a jumppad blueprint over https e.g. `https://nginx-80.local.jumppad.dev`.

The Jumppad CLI will automatically renew the local certificates when they expire.
